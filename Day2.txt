# Value vs. Reference Type

### Value Type

- Value type as the name suggest is a data type which when declared and assigned a value, holds the value directly on its own memory space.
- The value type uses a heap to store the value.
- Value types data types are int, float, long, double, char, bool, decimal, double, etc.

### Reference Type

- Reference types is a variable type which instead of storing the value in memory directly, stores the memory location of the actual data.
- The variable here stores the memory reference of the data and not the data directly.
- Reference type data types are string, class, Array etc.
- When we copy this reference type of a data type it will just copy the memory address of the data so we will then have two variables pointing to the the same date.

So reference types only point at the data and don’t actually store any data. That why if you update the value of a reference type it will re-assign the value to all variables pointing to that reference.

# Console Methods Explained

```csharp
Console.Write("Text here");
// Prints and keeps cursor on same line.
```

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Text here");
// Prints and puts the cursor on the next line.
```

```csharp
Console.Read();
// Takes in a single input of type string and 
// it returns the ASCII value of the input.
```

```csharp
Console.ReadLine(); 
// Takes a string or integer input and returns
//it as the Output value.
```

```csharp
Console.ReadKey();
//Takes a single input of type string and it
//returns the Key Info.
```

### Sample Code

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Hello Welcome"); 
	//Prints the text and jumps to a new line
	Console.Write("Hello");
	//Prints the text in the same line
	Console.ReadKey();
	//Stops the program from stopping until a 
	//key is pressed.
}
```
